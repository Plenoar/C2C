# C2C
Char2Char was developed as a way to map a user defined name to a an actual file name 
This was written in the hopes that the user doesnt have to define long lines of file names just to reference it .

Suppose your audio file is stored in ../audio/player/player_walk.wav
you can just use this tool to name it walking , and the library will find the original path
This was written for my audio engine

To use this library simply put the .c .h file in your codebase and compile together
